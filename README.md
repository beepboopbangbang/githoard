## Overview

The goal of GitHoard is to trivialize cloning repositories for future offline review.

Often, the process of copy & pasting a repository to the command line breaks focus and flow, and other Git GUI's perpetuate this problem by requiring the selecting of a directory before starting the clone process.

GitHoard solves this by overriding the HTTP protocols associated with GitHub (github-mac:// and github-win://) and Sourcetree (sourcetree://) as well as creating a new protocol (githoard://) then automatically cloning when a link using that protocol is clicked.
